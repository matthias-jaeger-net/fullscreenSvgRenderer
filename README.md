## Loosley based on the p5.js library 

Hello World. If you are looking for a finished product I warn you. I'm a curious person coding his own tools for fun. My work is inspired by https://p5js.org/ and https://processing.org/, wich are both excellent toolsets for creative coding. After using those for many years the basic concepts they bring are part of my way coding. With this bundle of functions I intend to mimic a processing workflow but render my output in a svg
